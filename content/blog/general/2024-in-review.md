2024 is almost over. It was a great year for me. I feel, more than any other year I grew a lot. The year was highlighted by doing hard things with my wife and daughter while keeping as calm as possible. This year was also highlighted by a four-month detail I did during the summer.

I'm looking forward to this year but, it promises to be a crazy, crazy year.

## Being a Dad

The most important part of 2024 for me was raising my daughter. I grew a lot as a person and my daughter transitioned from a helpless little nugget to a full-blown human being. We did so many new things together. We went to dozens of new parks, we went swimming, we went out to dinner, we went e-biking and to the river. We slept and we didn't sleep. We learned what is good to eat and cook and how to take breaks when we need it and how to lean on mamma and grandma when we need to and how to be there when mamma and grandma need it. We learned how to ride strider bikes, and we ate a ton of bananas.

I spent so much less time on this computer because of my daughter, which was hard but also so important.

## The MPSG

Probably the most enlightening thing I did for myself was complete a detail with the Mountain Planning Service Group.

## Building a House

## Neovim

## Less Alcohol, but still some, and more Exercise

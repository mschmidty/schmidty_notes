So long 2024. It was a great year for me. I feel, more than any other year, that I grew a lot personally and professionally. The year was highlighted by doing hard things with my wife and daughter and, for the most part, enjoying them. It was also a year where, for the first time, I considered leaving the federal workforce. This decision was complicated by an amazing detail with the Forest Service at the Mountain States Planning Group, which I would work for in a heartbeat.

## The Family

The most important part of 2024 for me was raising my daughter. This year my daughter transitioned from a helpless little nugget to a full-blown human being. We did so many new things together. We went to dozens of new parks, we went swimming, we went out to dinner, we went e-biking and to the river. We slept and we didn't sleep. We learned what is good to eat and cook and how to take breaks when we need it and how to lean on mamma and grandma when we need to and how to be there when mamma and grandma need a break. We learned how to ride strider bikes, and we ate a ton of bananas and cheese.

I spent so much less time on this computer because of my daughter, which was hard but also so good for me.

My daughter is quickly becoming a small human and is slowly becoming more interactive. I'm loving communicating with her (mostly she says "No" a lot).

## Work

Last year, work was aweful. I started a new job and that job was pretty terrible. I'm in a much better place with work now and am looking forward to this year. I don't think I am going to stay at my current job long, but knowing that is good.

One of the things that helped me get to a better place with work was a detail with a Planning Service Group. It was the first job I've had where I worked as a programmer daily. I loved it. And I think that moving forward I am going to try and move into a programming role somewhere.

## Building a House

One of the most taxing and exciting things I did this year was build a house. We aren't done yet but we are getting close. I feel like my wife and I have really hit our stride in this process. You hear the jokes about building a house causing couples to divorce. Well, I think Sabina and I grown closer. We aren't done yet, and there are a lot of interior design choices left but I think we are proving to be good partners when working on complex projects.

## Programming

### Lots of R

This year I embraced being an R programmer and less of a web developer. On my detail with the MPSG I worked on a data pipeline that made automated reports for Species of Conservation Concern evaluations. It was a crazy experience. In four months I pitched the idea, built the tools and output the reports. People were amazed on the team. The only bummer is I think they really would have liked to give me a permanent job and becuase the Forest Service Budget is so bad they could not.

Two things were really important to my success with the team. One was that I used a target's pipeline for the work I did with them. This really helped me keep things organized and in sync. I feel like ti helped me save a ton of time without actually realizing that it was saving me a lot of time. The second was using packages to maintain repeatable steps. This process had a lot of repetition. One of the most repeated steps was resolving taxonomies for species accross many lists and occurrence records. This step we automated through a function in a package. This allowed us to apply it over and over again in a repeatable way. It was honestly one of the coolest things I've made.

### Neovim

This year I also made the change from VS Code to Neovim and I think it was a large part of why I was successful at the MPSG. I'm a very distractable person. Neovim helps me stay in the editor and not moving from the mouse to the keys often helps me stay focused and on task. Neovim can also be a distraction so I had to be careful not to get to into my config file which I was mostly successful at. But there are so many nice customizations, from how you move from file to file, to how you add Zotero citations to a references.bib file in quarto and markdown.

I've also become pretty obsessed with my terminal. I just started using Ghostty after using Wezterm for a while. I don't think it is good to change tools that often but I'm passionate about my tools so I'm not too upset that I've changed a few times lately. I was using VS code and warp terminal for a long time.

I think this year it would be good to familiarize myself with tmux although I'm always a bit reticent to use a tool that I can't use at both work and home.

## Life

### Less Alcohol, but still some, and more sleep

One of the biggest changes that I made at the end of 2024 is to stop drinking alcohol every day. I don't think I've ever had a problem with alcohol, but I definitely have gotten into the habit of drinking a beer or glass of wine every night and it just seemed pointless. It adds zero value to my life when I drink like that. Am I going to quit drinking all together, no. Some of my favorite times are grabbing a drink with friends at a bar or over dinner and having a great conversation. Or going for a long bike ride and then having a beer.

The end of drinking every night was spurred by the fact that 2023 was a rough year for sleeping for me and I found that if I stopped drinking it helped me sleep better.

### More Excersize

I exercised a lot in 2024 and I loved every minute of it. One of the hardest parts about moving to Durango and Building a house is that we are temporarily in a tiny house with a toddler and two 100 pound dogs. So getting out and exercising is a must for me.

Last year here is my exercise breakdown:

**Run**

- Time: 52h 48m
- Distance: 309.4 miles
- Elevation Gain: 26,993 ft
- Number of Activities: 58

**Ride**

- Time: 157h 53m
- Distance: 1,367.3 mi
- Elevation Gain: 199,909 ft
- Number of Activities: 73

I also logged 2 Rock Climbs, but I usually don't log those.

That is a lot of exercise. I'd like to see if I can exceed that number this year. The goal is total time really: So, we are shooting for more than 210 hours of exercise. That seems like a lot but it just isn't. I remember when I used to ride up to 30 hours a week when I was in college.

I think the goal is I really want to try and get really fit again, maybe do some bike races or running races in 2025. I'm not unfit but it's felt grate to start to get more fit this year and I'd like to keep that trend going.

## Looking Back at what I wanted from 2024

I set four goals for myself for 2024:

- Fewer Cell Phones and Tablets and Maybe Fewer Computers, Attempting to Truly Unplug.
- More writing
- More Time With Maddie and More Trips
- Find Time For Creativity

### Fewer cell phones, tablets and computers.

I definetley didn't succeed with fewer cell phones or tablets. I've mostly been off social media for the last few years with the exception of using Mastadon, and now BluSky, on my phone and Reddit and YouTube on my Tablet. But this year I found myself going down the rabbithole of YouTube shorts. An hour can go by and I can hardly realize that it has while watching YouTube shorts. I've also found that It is kind of nice to Zone out after a hard day of work or after not sleeping very well. I'm not sure how I feel about this moving forward. I think less tablets and phones is a good thing. I also think this comes up because I probably spend more time on my phone around this time of year than any other and when I write this I need a break. So mixed feelings about this moving forward.

As far as computer stuff goes, I did so much with my computer at work this year that I hardly touched my computer at home. This blog only had six posts. I'm OK with that. I'm building a house, raising a kid and working really hard. At some point I'd really like to get into a grove with writing. So I guess I kind of reached this goal.

### More writing

As I said above I did less computer stuff in general. I also wrote less. It's so hard to find time with a two year old to write. I wrote six journal entries on a private blog and I wrote five posts to my daughter. I guess, in all that might be enough 18 posts in total.

### More time with Maddie and more trips

We went on a lot of family trips this year. It didn't seem like that many but we did make it to a lot. We went to two big weddings, one in Oregon but the other 30 minutes away. The one in Oregon was Amazing, we went with my wife's family to the Oregon Coast and then to my wife's cousins wedding outside of Eugene. The Coast was spectacular. It was my daughter's first time at the beach and the firt time we all flew as a family. We also went to Idaho with my family which was a 13 hour drive in total. We also got out and camped with Maddie which was great.

I think getting out more with Maddie will be a goal again this year.

### Find time for Creativity

I'm not sure that I did this at all. I didn't touch my camera. I hardly did anything artistic. I guess you could consider designing a house as something creative. I think it is.

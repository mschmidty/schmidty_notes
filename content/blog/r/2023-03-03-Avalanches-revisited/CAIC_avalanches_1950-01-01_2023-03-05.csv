We skinned up the east ridge of Trico -  and (unwisely) dropped in to the northeast bowl at 12 - 400 ft at about 10:30am.  The first skier triggered the avalanche when he was several hundred feet down; the entire face ripped out with a crown between 1-2 feet deep.  We all yelled Avalanche! which he heard -  and he was able to ski to his left out of the way the main big avalanche; however -  as he continued to his left he triggered another slide which eventually swept him down the slope.  In the attached photo below -  which is looking back up -  you can see the crown of the first (biggest) part of the slide at the left saddle; this part of the slide mostly funneled through that choke. The skier skied left and triggered the second part of the slide which you can see more clearly directly above.The skier managed to keep his orientation (he didn't tumble) and was buried up to his neck; his face was free and he had one arm out. We could see him waving so we didn't have to do a beacon search. We skied directly down through the debris -  which was actually still quite soft -  and quickly dug him out.  The snow had firmly trapped his body -  but was still soft enough for us to easily dig him out.  He was uninjured and still had his skis on (lost one pole).  The slide started at 12 - 400 and the debris stopped at about 11 - 800 feet.  All the new powder slid on the hard -  crusty old snow surface.We skied out to the road taking as safe a route as we could to avoid exposing ourselves to potentially triggering more slides from below. At the pass we saw two emergency vehicles from Montrose (who were already based in Ouray due to the mining accident up Camp Bird); apparently someone across the road (probably on McMillan) saw the slide and phoned Mtn. Rescue.  We spoke with the responders and notified them that we were the group that triggered the slide and that we were alright.",,12400,ft,I,,,300,,ft,1000,,ft,20,30,in,

We had decided not to ski that line because of the shape/slope and wind loading. Estimated wind loaded soft slab of 1-2'. We skied down the uphill flank of the path between the headwall (with convexity) and visible scree as safest 'skiable' route down. Party of 8. 4th skier down fell at turn 3. A few seconds later spotter above yelled 'avalanche' and we observed upper part of path break (uphill of the portion we considered to be wind loaded). Stauchwall was ~ 30' from skier who fell. Slide appeared to be remotely triggered by this fall but no cracks propagated from fall point or any ski tracks. Spotter had planned to ski this line as last man down. Slab broke to the ground and ran on scree. Was too dangerous to get next to crown due to hangfire -  but deepest part of crown 12-15'! Slab accelerated quickly and ran ~100' lower than I expected when I saw it release (based on previous ski patrol experience with ski cuts and explosives).In retrospect we picked a good line down. Last man down 'spotter' was a bit shaken that he had planned to take a line 40' downhill -  above previously observed load and below others' route. Was very large and beautiful. If it would have run on a snow bed surface I would rate this as a survivable avalanche with probable shallow burial.

We planned to stay in the trees located 100-200 ft to rider's left. We thought we could drop from where we attained the ridge and with a slight left traverse after the first low angle turns we could enter into the solidly treed area. Unfortunately -  the slope contoured to rider's right -  away from the trees and before we realized this we were too far right to safely traverse. There were two routes through a small cliff/rock band below us. Neither were desirable. We discussed hiking back up - very briefly. Another mistake. We opted for the route through the rocks to rider's right as the pitch was less steep and the slope featured a bench about half way down. I had done a couple of cuts and hard jumps above this area with no movement but did not try to cut this slope. I entered the pitch -  made a single turn when the avalanche occured. It broke approximately 25 ft above me and 30 ft below me. I tried to ride out of it to rider's left but was quickly -  yet gently knocked off my board and onto my belly. I floated on the top at relatively slow speed for approx 50-60 vert ft - maybe 100-120 ft down slope. As I neared the bench in the slope -  which is lightly treed -  the slide slowed and I came to a stop next to a small tree. I called to my partner that I was okay. He descended on the bed surface to my location. We took a few photos and exited the remaining pitch next to the debris below. We both had beacons -  probes and shovels and have attended avy classes. We were on splitboards. We did not dig a pit. We read the CAIC forecast that day which -  as it turns out was spot on.

We were attempting to climb and ski the south slopes of Uncompahgre Peak.  We were approaching Uncompahgre and came upon a fairly large avalanche path that funneled into a gully.  The gully was approximately 60' wide.  The opposite side of the gully was a terrain trap itself.  We noted a break in the gully's pitch and a low angle section of gully we thought we would be able to cross safely.  Looking up neither me nor my partner felt there was enough volume of snow in the path above to come low enough down to hit us where we thought would be safe to cross.  My partner watched me from a safe zone as I skin traversed across the gully on the flat section.  I crossed the gully and just as I started to skin up the 25 degree break in the terrain trap I heard a large whump and looked below.  A pretty good sized slide was breaking off about 50 feet below me (D2-R3ish -  the avalanche dimensions described in the report are for the larger slide that occured at the same time above me -  that is described just below).  I then looked up and saw that the initiation zone of the slide path I was crossing was running down on top of me as well.  I ran(skinned as fast as possible) to the side.  Fortunately both slides ran about as we expected and the main deposition zone of the avalanche above stopped a couple hundred feet above my location.  It also pulled out the side of the gully down to within about 50' of me -  blurring the lines between crown line and flank on one side.  We did a lot right and we also made a mistake (any avalanche you trigger and are underneath is a mistake).  We knew the avalanche rating was considerable and personal observations confirmed this.  We knew that we were in complex terrain -  discussed our options -  and found the safest line possible to cross the path after a fairly extended conversation about the probabilities of the slope above running and the probabilities of it hitting us -  crossing it where we were planning too.  We exposed one person to the path at a time.  Due to these terrain decisions -  observations -  and the prior discussion -  I did cross at the right place.  Everything above me ripped out and everything below me ripped out and I was left standing in a lower angle swath of snow that was about 100' vertical feet in height (with a slide above me and a slide below me).  I was still pretty shocked to have triggered something from 500' above my location.  So our predictions were wrong because we did not think we could trigger the slide from that distance below.  However -  safe travel procedures did quite possibly save my life as well.  If we had not recognized that 'safer' area and I had crossed at any other point -  I would have probably been buried by either the slide that ran above me or the slide that ran below me. Safe travel procedures played a role in the day's outcome and inaccurate predictions to the possiblities of remotely triggering the slide contributed to the avalanche incident.  In the end -  everything worked out -  but it was way to close for comfort.",35,12200,ft,O,Layer,Faceted Crystals,200,400,ft,300,400,ft,,,,

I was carried more than 50 feet from where I was caught. I estimate the three members of my group rescued me within 2 mins of being buried. I was carried over 50 feet and able to get a hand above the surface of the snow which helped my group locate me and speed the rescue. I was wearing a bca airbag pack -  which I deployed as soon as I was pushed over. I'm uncertain whether it was helpful -  but I was very close to the surface.  The slide we triggered propagated very far -  maybe 1000 feet across on shallow snow at the rock bands. The portion of the slide that buried me couldn't have run more than 50 vertical feet above me and triggered as soon as I was in the worst part of the terrain trap we were crossing. I was probably around 20 feet from safety -  when I heard my group members shouting at me. When I looked uphill -  it was too late. The wet heavy snow felt like cement around my feet. Within seconds -  I was pushed head downhill even though I fought hard to stay head uphill. I was so thankful the slide stopped very quickly. If the slide had continued over the edge of the gully -  I'm not sure I would still be here. I was able to dig towards my face with my free hand -  but my group was able to clear my airway before I was. We also noted a large slide in coyote tooth that had a seperate crown in the apron below the chute. Not sure you'll be able to make out the crowns from my photos.

The second skier into the top of the rib triggered a 4' wide slough of snow which went all the way to the ground (75 cm?) and grew from there. There was no propagation as the point release was started completely by the skier. The slide sieved through the saplings and ran to the floor.

This larger slide was also strained through the trees below -  running larger and farther than the first slide. Our main concern with skiing the slide path was that there were three smaller pockets still not triggered that if released above us would push us through the trees.

My ski partner had skied a treed lower angle run in Root Creek a few days prior and had observed no signs of instability.With this information in mind we decided to drop in and further investigate the snow pack in a more representative location if we felt the need to do so. I dropped in first and skied on a ridge line before stopping on the ridge at the top of a large opening in the trees(and probably the main starting zone to this branch of the avalanche path) where the slope angle stepped to around 37 degrees. At this point the snow was no longer scoured and I noticed faceted snow at the base of the pack with a ski pole test and possible wind load along the ridge.Skier two dropped in and skied the skiers right margin of the trees and sought shelter behind trees and a rock feature on the skiers left ridge line. After asking skier two if he was in a good spot I skied off the ridge and did a ski cut across the top of the opening and thought that I saw a crack shoot out from under my skis half way across the 40 foot opening (although I was not sure I had seen a crack). After skiing a ways into the trees -  I looked back and saw the slope beginning to fracture and move and yelled avalanche My partner was already aware of this because he had heard a loud collapsing noise that I had not heard and had seen the slope fracture when I crossed it.The slide ran on the ground surface and traveled approximately 400 vertical feet with the debris accumulating on slopes of 35 to 30 degrees in the lower track. The initial slab also triggered a second slab avalanche that propagated over the lower -  more gentle ridge line into the more westerly avalanche path.The deepest snow depositions -  three to four feet -  were behind trees in the upper track and on the flank of the slide. We did not examine the up crown due to the time of day and the remaining hang fire. It is unknown if wind loading on the side of the ridge or buried surface hour -  which may have been been present in the large open area were contributing factors to the slide.This was a very dangerous and humbling incident that my partner and I could have easily avoided.We made several poor judgement calls leading up to the incident -  including:1.Not stopping in a safe location to further asses the stability.2.Being in a hurry because the day was getting late and because were getting tired from skiing for most of the day.3. Having a false sense of security because my partner had observed no instabilities in the immediate vicinity a few days prior -  and because we had observed no major instabilities on the day of the incident.The exception being my failure to communicate my concerns about the presence of the faceted basal layer and thin snow pack to my partner before he skid below me.4. Familiarity. My ski partner and I had both skied in Root Creek a fair amount in past seasons and had never observed a slide of this magnitude (even-though we were skiing an obvious avalanche path with vegetative damage evident of frequent avalanche activity).5. We could have skirted the starting zone -  traveled in lower angled and more densely wooded terrain.6. Powder Fever7. The line had already been skied -  which I should never let boost my confidence.

Path ran 30 ft wide (in a gully) and for 1000ft.  Nobody was injured.  At that point -  snow was very poorly bonded to the dust layer beneath -  and the crown was about 1-2 feet -  or all the new snow.  Snow was wet and carred mass enought to burry a person.  Multiple small slides were set off with 2nd in party coming down.  Areas even with high anchor points were releasing and travelling 100 yards into more trees.

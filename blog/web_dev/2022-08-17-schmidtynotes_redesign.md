About a year ago I redesigned this site.  I mostly liked my old site, but I wanted to move away from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).  I really liked jekyll.  But programming brings too many technologies to learn.  I've been heading down the javascript path for a while now learning express.js and p5.  I wanted to complete my transformation with the move to [Eleventy (or 11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/).  This post is will go over a few problems I had moving from Jekyll to Eleventy, and how I solved them, and talk about some of the new features of the new site. 

Just a note, this isn't a tutorial.  If you are looking for a post on how to switch from Jekyll to Eleventy, I suggest the [24 Ways post by Paul Lloyd](https://24ways.org/2018/turn-jekyll-up-to-eleventy/).

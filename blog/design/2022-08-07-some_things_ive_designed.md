Over the last few years, I've designed a few things that I'd like to share.  Some for clients, some for fun, and some to bring recycling to my community.  I don't do a ton of designing, so when I do design something and it turns out well I feel like sharing. 

## Logos

I've designed two logos that I really like. The first is for [The River Radius Podcast](https://www.theriverradius.com/).  A few years ago, my old landlord Sam asked if I'd help him design a logo for his new podcast about rivers.  Even though I'd never designed a logo  before I figured I could try.  Sam already had a pencil drawn mockup which helped. I really like how it came out, and I'm really impressed with the podcast the logo represents.  Sam tells important stories about the rivers, the people who love them, the people that need them and the wildlife that depend on them.

The second logo I've mad is a logo for my good friend and first ever client, [Durango Shade Company](https://durangoshadeco.com). I designed Durango Shade Companie'sfirst logo, which was ok but it was hard to tell what it was.  It was just some blocks. This new logo is simple, clean and can be displayed at lots of different sizes.

## Kind of #rtistry

I designed this poster using Digital Elevation Models of where I grew up on the Wasatch front in Utah. For a while I was interested in making maps that artistically and programmatically showed where I have lived and live.  Interestingly, by far the most interesting place that I've lived for this project was Salt Lake City.  Particularly for this piece which shows how drastic the Wasatch are.

## Recycling

And lastly, maybe the thing that I am most proud of is the signs I designed for the recycling non-profit that I was on the board of for several years.  These have zero flash but serve a purpose, get their point across and are easy to read.  I walk by them all the time and am proud to have made them because they help people recycle.

I don't have a ton of time to design but I like when I do.  I hope to do it more in the future.

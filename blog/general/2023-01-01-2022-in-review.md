What a year.  Like most years it seemed to go by in an instant. Personally and professionally it was a successful year.  I did a lot and learned a lot. I failed some, which I'm proud of. And to wrap things up, my life changed at the end of the year and it will never be the same. 

## The Personal Bits
At the end of this year, my wife and I welcomed a little girl. I've always wanted to be a father and on December 4th at 2:26 pm I got my wish.  So far being a father has been easier in some ways and harder in others. I sleep more than I expected.  But keeping the nugget (my daughters current nickname) happy has been more work than I expected.  My wife and I are very much trying to figure things out.  Some days are wonderful.  Some days end in tears.  My wife and I are helping each other more than ever and that feels good.  But how much I code on the side, how much I excercise, and how much I socialize are all in flux at the moment.  

Other than welcoming the nugget my wife and I designed an addition that we hope to get underway this spring.  We want to add on a master bedroom, master bathroom and office into our very non-tradtional bardominium. 

## Professionally
The biggest thing for me this year was that I applied for several jobs.  I didn't get any of them — at least so far —  but it had been a while since I applied for a job and I needed to nock some rust off of my Resume, interviewing and application skills. I applied to a non-government techish job with a water data and research organization.  I got two interviews, one of which was a coding interview.  I did not get the job.  I didn't have a lot of the skills that they needed and did a pretty poorly in the first interview with the person who would have been my boss. 

I also applied for several government jobs and details.  One of the details I applied for would have been as a data analyst for the AIM program with the Bureua of Land Management National Operations Center.  I was number two unfortunately but was surprised that I was considered at all.  It was a reminder that it is good to put yourself out there because you never know what is going to happen. The other detail I applied for was also with the NOC as a remote sensing specialist.  I was selected for the position but ultimately turned it down because I would have been on parental leave for much of the time that I was in the role.  

I applied for one job with the Forest Service as a Wildlife Biologist and was denied because my performance appraisal that I submitted was 20 months, two months two old apparently (gotta read that fine print).  Apparently they Forest Service didn't have enough candidates and I have applied again for the position.  However, I recently got notice that my performance appraisal was not accepted again.  This time I have no idea why.  It is from December 2021 so it should be within the right time.  I've appealed.  I guess the Forest Service really wants small applicant pools so that they don't have to make any decisions.  

I also just applied to be an Ecologist at Mesa Verde National Park — we'll see how that goes — and to be the Colorado Monitoring Coordinator for the BLM which I didn't qualify due to time and grade.

I'm happy I applied for all of these rolls.  I'm kind of two minds right now about my career.  I really like my current roll and I don't want to leave it for something that I don't like. But I've been in my role as a Wildlife Biologist for 7 year now.  This coming season will be my 8th year.  I'm starting to get antsy and sometimes board with my current roll.  I can always find interesting things to work on, but it is a fine line between working on interesting things and not getting the things I need to done. 

Speaking of interesting things. I've really gotten into the nitty gritty of R and GIS at my job.  In the last month I've been diving into our offices [Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring (AIM)](https://www.blm.gov/aim/strategy) data.  We just finished our fifth year of monitoring concluding our first Field Office wide sample.  I built several packages to help me load and QA/QC the data from various sources (found [here](https://github.com/mschmidty/AimSqlTools) and [here](https://github.com/mschmidty/AIMtools))and I've been using the [`{targets}`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package to help manage my workflow for the analysis. In the next couple of months I'll be summarizing the data for all five years. In the mean time, to prepare for our next five year sample, which I will be wrapping up here in the next few weeks, I built vegetation benchmarks by [Ecological Site Group](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5f76119e82cef8d1839c681d) based on all existing AIM data. If you are familiar with Ecological Site Descriptions, Ecological Site Groups are very similar. Where Ecological Site Descriptions are very analogue and were created using on the ground data collection, Ecological Site Groups were predicted using machine learning (If you are interested the full paper can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550742421001251?via%3Dihub)).  I hope to put something up on my process in the next few weeks but time isn't really on my side these days. 

## Semi-Professional
Outside of work, but still kind of work, the kids bike non-profit that my wife and I started and run with the help of a bunch of amazing people grew into a full fledged program.  [High Desert Devo](https://www.highdesertdevo.org/) added an elementary school program to our existing middle and high school programs. We hired an Executive Director full time and a Program Director part time.  It's great to see a program that we have spent so much of our free time building take off.  And its nice to that we can start to take a back-seat to the employees who are making the program their own. 

Another semi-pro area I made big decisions about in 2022 is I've decided to stop providing web services as a side gig.  I don't have time and I haven't been doing a very good job for a few years.  I feel like for those that I do provide services I am kind of crutch.  I'm cheap and easy, but they would be better served building something themselves or finding someone who could be more dedicated. 

## 2023
Not sure what 2023 will bring.  I'm kind of at the whim of the little one.  A continuous goal for me has been to share what I do more.  I've been bad at that.  I definitly have imposter syndrome a lot of the time.  Taking care of a toddler may impede that goal and that is OK.  

I'd also like to say "No" to more.  Like I said above I took a step back from web development last year and it felt good.  I'd also like to step back from other things too.  Maybe it's time to step back from High Desert Devo.  We'll see. I believe in addition through subtraction at this point and it's become clear to me that I do too much.  I'd like to enjoy the things I do a little more but do a little less.   

The last thing is I'd like to continue to learn new things.  I'm always tinckering away with code at something.  This year I got a lot better at javascript.  Next year I'd like to get better at statistical analysis.  I'm reading "Ecological Models and Data in R" right now.  I'm enjoying it so far.  I tend to get about 2 chapters into text books and give up.  Hopefully that doesn't happen this year.

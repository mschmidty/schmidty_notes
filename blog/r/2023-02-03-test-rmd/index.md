I write a lot of R in my life. I’m also a web developer that does most
of my writing on this blog in markdown. Up until now these two worlds
have been separate. I know and use Rmarkdown at work but it always has
seemed like a pain to get Rmarkdown to work on this site which is
generated using 11ty (eleventy). Up until now, to get my R work on this
site, I have been writing R in another document and manually copying
over code and outputs to markdown files on this site. Given how
ineficient that process is, I figured it was time to figure out how to
write Rmarkdown and render it more seamlessly with this site.

To be clear, this isn’t some automated system to get Rmarkdown to build
with eleventy. What it is, is a system to write Rmarkdown, then render
that document to a markdown file using R so that eleventy, or another
static site generator, can build it into the site. This also isn’t a
process for folks who just want to write Rmarkdown and nothing else. For
those folks I’d recommend something like blogdown. This is kind of a
unique case because I post about things other than R on my blog so I
like the flexibility of a non R centric system.

As proof of concept, this page is an Rmarkdown document that I’m
rendering to a `md` document and converting to `html` with eleventy.

## Eleventy Configuration

First, you need to put your Rmarkdown file in a folder is named like a
post typically would be with the post slug. For example I put this post
in a folder named `2023-02-03-test-rmd/` in a folder with all my other
posts. Within that folder you put your Rmarkdown file and name it
`index.Rmd`. Now when you run
`rmarkdown::render("2023-02-03-test-rmd/index.Rmd")` a `index.md` file
will be rendered in your post folder and an images folder will be
created with all of your assets that Rmarkdown generates, which is
typically just images of plots. All of the image paths should work
without any eleventy changes (after completing the next step). I’m not
sure about other static site generators, but I would imagine this would
work in some.

Next, we need to make some eleventy config (`.eleventy.js` for most)
changes so that images generated by Rmarkdown will be added to the
\_site folder. Rmarkdown `render` generates all documents in the current
folder, including the images. The way I have my 11ty site setup
currently is that I put all images in an assets folder that is outside
of my posts folder and I add a pass through copy to the site folder. No
other images are copied to the site folder. If the goal is to make this
as easy as possible we need to add a line to our configuration that will
copy all images to our `_site` folder keeping their original file
structure. To do this you can add a `addPassthroughCopy()` in your
`.eleventy.js` configuration file.

``` js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig){
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("blog/r/**/*.png")
}
```

I limited to the copy to my `blog/r/` folder becuase that is where
Rmarkdown files will be and I don’t want to copy over my assets folder
twice which would return an error. That’s it. That is all the eleventy
configuration you need to do. Now let’s move on the the Rmarkdown file.

## Rmarkdown front matter

The important part here is the output section. This is what Rmarkdown
uses to determine how to render your Rmarkdown.

``` yml

# Above this is eleventy. Below this is Rmarkdown
output:
  md_document:
    variant: commonmark
    preserve_yaml: TRUE
    df_print: tibble
---
```

The output says markdown document with `md_document`, that is rendered
using `commonmark` syntax, preserving the yaml (otherwise it is
removed), and the `df_print: tibble` is optional to output tables in
trunkated fashion.

The last thing I needed to do was add a chunk option for my Rmarkdown
chunks that would wrap the chunk outputs in code blocks. You can do this
like so:

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  class.output="r"
)
```

After that you should be able to write Rmarkdown in you eleventy site.
When you render the Rmarkdown, it should create a markdown document that
can be ingested by eleventy to make static html.

As proof, below is just Rmarkdown rendered with
\`rmarkdown::render(“path/to/index.Rmd”)

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
penguins
```

``` r

This is some text.

``` r

  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="Made this in Rmarkdown")+
  geom_jitter(width=0.1, alpha=0.5, size=2)+
  theme_minimal()

I'm terrible at statistics. So I've been trying to learn.  I'm taking the edX class Statistics and R which is part of the [Data Analysis for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences).  

I've become quite confused about the central limit theorem.  I get it at a basic level, but at a nuts and bolts level it is very confusing.  More specifically, how to calculate standard deviation, standard error, t-statistics and p-values and how they are related.  So I though I would write a note to wrap my head around it.

`n` is inversely proportional to `standard deviation`.

## Definitions
**Variance** - Standard deviation squared.
**Sample Variance of your Sampling Distribution Mean** = variance of your original distribution / `n`
**Standard Deviation of the Mean** = Standard Deviation of your original distribution/ square root of `n`

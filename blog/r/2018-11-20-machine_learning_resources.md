A collection of resources on data science and machine learning primarily in R.

## R Resources
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - an introduction to R and the [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/) by [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). If you are just getting into R, start here.  
* [Advanced R - Second Addition](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) - another resource from Hadley Wickham.

## Machine Learning
* [Andrew Ng's ML Course on Corsera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* [Distill: Writing from some of the Best in ML](https://distill.pub/)
* [Landscape Classification with Deep Neural Networks](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/8/7/244)
* [Tidy Forecasting in R with Fable](http://fable.tidyverts.org/), [Tutorial 1](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/blog/fable/) and [Tutorial 2](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/fable/)
* [Hands-On Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/index.html) - Probably the best overall resource I've found to date.

## Data Visualization
* [R Graph Gallery with examples](http://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html)
* [Tidy Tuesday Data Visualization Submissions](https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/)
* [Data to Vis](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) - a compendium of data visualization resources in R by [Yan Holtz](https://twitter.com/R_Graph_Gallery). This resource includes D3.js resources as well.
* [Raster Heatmap NYT Style](https://www.katiejolly.io/blog/2019-08-28/nyt-urban-heat) by [Katie Jolly](https://twitter.com/katiejolly6).
* [Professional Graphs in R](https://github.com/clauswilke/practical_ggplot2) by [Clause Wilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke)

## GIS with R
* [Geocomputing with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/index.html)
* [JAKUB NOWOSAD'S WEBSITE](https://nowosad.github.io) - Mapping and geoecology with R.
* [MARCO SCIAINI](https://marcosci.rbind.io/) - More mapping and geoecology.
* [Katie Jolly's Website](https://www.katiejolly.io/portfolio/) - Really well designed mapping visualizations.
* [Zevross Slides on Modern GIS in R](http://files.zevross.com/workshops/spatial/slides/html/0-deck-list.html).  Covers mapping with R from the bottom up using {dplyr}, {sf}, {tmap}, and {raster}.  Has a section on interactive maps.

## Statistics
* [EdX Statistics and R](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r) - Which is part of [Data Analysis for Life Sciences Course](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences)
*  [Model Selection 101, using R](https://medium.com/@peter.nistrup/model-selection-101-using-r-c8437b5f9f99)
* [Interpreting Models](https://medium.com/@peter.nistrup/visualizing-models-101-using-r-c7c937fc5f04)
* [An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R](https://moderndive.com/)

## The Kitchen Sink
* [Data Science Glossary](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/data-science-glossary-on-kaggle-updated)
* [Shirin's playgRound - amazing blog about all things R](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/)

## Datasets
* [TidyTuesday Rep](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

## Inspiration
* [Observable Visualizations](https://beta.observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/visualization)


## Python

[Problem solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html)
[Python Mapping](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro)

## Ecology
* [r-spatial ecology - set of tools for ecologists](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar)
* [Data Science for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course_home/) - Good course on modeling here.
